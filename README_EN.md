### 🔌 Plugin System

| Plugin | Description |
|-----|-----|
| **SponsorBlock** | Automatically skip ads/sponsor segments based on BilibiliSponsorBlock database |
| **AdBlock** | Smartly filter commercial content from recommendation feeds |
| **Danmaku Plus** | Keyword blocking and highlighting for personalized danmaku experience |
| **Eye Protection** | Scheduled eye care, 3 presets + DIY tuning, real-time preview, warm filter, humane reminders with snooze |

| **Plugin Center** | Unified management for all plugins with independent configurations |
| **🆕 External Plugins** | Support loading dynamic JSON rule plugins via URL |

#### Implemented Details (Supplement)

- `Today Watch`:
  - dual mode switch: `Relax Tonight` / `Deep Learning`
  - UP ranking + recommendation queue + per-item explanation tags
  - queue rows display uploader avatar + name for better readability
  - linked with eye-care night signal (prefers shorter, lower-stimulation content at night)
  - local negative-feedback learning (disliked video/uploader/keywords)
  - one-shot cold-start exposure strategy so users can see the card on first screen
  - one-tap reset of local profile + feedback in plugin settings
- `Eye Protection 2.0`:
  - 3 presets (`Gentle/Balanced/Focus`) + full DIY controls
  - real-time brightness and warm-filter preview
  - schedule + usage reminders + snooze
  - improved humane reminder copy and pacing strategy
- `Quality Switching`:
  - quality options now follow the API list, while real DASH tracks decide which tiers stay switchable
  - cache switching requires exact target quality match; falls back to API when missing
  - clearer fallback toast when requested quality is unavailable

#### Today Watch UI Example

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/images/screenshot_today_watch_plan.png" alt="Today Watch screenshot" height="560">
</p>

#### Today Watch Algorithm (Detailed)

1. Inputs

- history sample from local watch history
- candidate videos from home recommend feed
- mode (`Relax` or `Learn`)
- eye-care night signal
- creator profile signals (cross-session local memory)
- penalty signals (disliked video/uploader/keywords)

2. Creator affinity build-up

- filter valid history items (`bvid` not empty, valid `owner.mid`)
- aggregate per-creator score with completion + recency bonus
- merge cross-session profile signals from local store

3. Candidate scoring

- score = base popularity + creator affinity + freshness + mode score + night adjustment + feedback penalty + seen penalty
- seen videos are explicitly penalized
- mode score differs for Relax and Learn (duration + keyword orientation)
- night adjustment favors short, low-stimulation items

4. Diversity queue

- queue is not pure score sort
- each round applies anti-streak penalties for repeated creators
- includes novelty bonus for unseen creators in the current queue

5. Explainability and privacy

- each queued item has explanation tags (e.g. `Learn · Mid Length · Night Friendly · Preferred Uploader`)
- runs fully local; no history upload for personalization
- users can clear local profile/feedback and restart recommendation learning

## 🔄 Changelog

See full changelog: [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md)

### Latest (v7.4.2 · 2026-04-05)

- 🎯 **Regular video startup is now closer to PiliPlus**: the first `WBI` request starts from `qn=80`, and downgraded-but-playable results are accepted so playback can choose the actual track locally.
- 🛟 **Playback URL fallback is more resilient**: logged-in users now keep `APP access_token -> legacy -> guest` as recovery paths, while guest playback retains a `legacy` fallback for empty `WBI` payloads.
- 🌫️ **Glass badges on thumbnails are easier to read**: history/favorites/home cover pills now use a darker glass base so duration and watched-progress text stay legible on bright thumbnails.
- 💬 **Danmaku spacing settings finally take effect**: line-height settings are now converted into the pixel values expected by the renderer, fixing the “comments collapse into each other” issue.
- 🔒 **Player gesture/lock behavior is cleaner**: pinch-based viewport transforms are no longer active during playback, and the fullscreen lock button now shows the correct lock/unlock icon state.
- ⚙️ **Build stability improved**: KSP incremental flags, configuration-cache-safe directory prep, and a policy split for the large player section file make incremental builds steadier.
